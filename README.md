# komorebi-visualizer

Console application for [komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi) that shows what monitor, workspace, and container is currently selected, made to get my head around how komorebi works.

To run and subscribe to the named pipe:

```csharp
dotnet run
komorebic subscribe komorebi-pipe
```
